# Topic_Modeling_DA
## Basic text preprocessing and topic modeling
 * ### The goal of this assignment is to get familiar with textual data analysis.

 * ### Task 1: The given dataset is a table containing questions about R on StackOverflow site. Your first task is to perform standard text prepossessing steps introduced in lectures for future tasks. You can perform analysis on title or body of the questions.

 * ### Task 2: Using existing libraries, such as gensim https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/ to learn word embeddings from the prepossessed text from previous step. At the end of this step, you should save the learned word embeddings in a file.
